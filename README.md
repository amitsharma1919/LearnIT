# LearnIT

This project is a moodle clone built using Django for backend, Django rest framework and a React frontend. Instructors can create assignments which can be attempted by students. The student can also see his individual performance compared with other students. This app can be extended to other domains like creating a workout schedule by fitness trainers.
